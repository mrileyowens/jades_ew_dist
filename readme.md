Things to do:

- Compare EWs of galaxies that Ryan directly states
- Check his paper again to confirm our priors are as similar as possible
- Write about possible methodological differences in measuring the EWs from the SEDs
- Write about possible differences in choosing which filter to use for the EW priors

Galaxies from Ryan's catalog that he directly plots / states properties of in his paper

Figure 5:

1. 32764_GOODSN / JADES-GN+189.19124+62.19952:
redshift: 5.9, 5.67
mass: 327, 251
age: 62, 54
Photometry looks identical

2. 104864_GOODSS / JADES-GS+53.07081-27.70674:
redshift: 6.0, 6.01
mass: 298, 251
age: 41, 47
Photometry looks identical, except maybe one of the filters shortward of the Lyman break (tough to tell since Ryan plots upper limits, not the measurements)

3. 147986_GOODSS / JADES-GS+53.13515-27.77946:
redshift: 6.0, 5.73
mass: 24, 12.6
age: 56, 31
Photometry looks identical, except some scatter in the HST filters shortward of the Lyman break

4. 80873_GOODSS / JADES-GS+53.15167-27.80925:
redshift: 6.0, 5.66
mass: 31, 25
age: 90, 79
Photometry looks identical, even including the discrepancies between the model and observed photometry

age: 352, 533
Photometry looks identical, including notable discrepancies between the observed and model photometry

2. 30279_GOODSN / JADES-GN+189.27602+62.19577:
redshift: 6.6, 6.16
mass: 1537, ...
age: 470, 460
Photometry looks identical

3. 84049_GOODSS / JADES-GS+53.16401-27.80504:
redshift: 6.1, 5.91
mass: 463, ...
age: 526, 332
The photometry looks identical

redshift: 6.0, 5.95
mass: 165, ...
age: 12, 10
The photometry looks nearly identical, apart from a difference in one of the model photometry shortward of the Lyman break

2. 24071_GOODSN / JADES-GN+189.33577+62.18652:
redshift: 6.0, 6.00
mass: 32, ...
age: 5, 5
The photometry looks identical, apart from the flux density in F435W, which is higher in my plot
